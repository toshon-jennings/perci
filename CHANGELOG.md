# Changelog

## [0.50.0] - 2026-08-23
### Added
- **Dotenvx GUI window** — first-class Perci window embedding the local Dotenvx GUI (`~/dotenvx-gui`, port 7843) via an isolated `persist:perci-dotenvx` Electron webview, since Dotenvx blocks iframe embedding to protect local environment files (`src/components/DotenvxMode.jsx`, `src/context/ModeContext.jsx`, `src/components/windows/Dock.jsx` "DX" chip, `src/lib/perciSurfaceMap.js` local-runtime station).
- **Dotenvx auto-install** — when `~/dotenvx-gui` doesn't exist, the window's offline screen offers **Install Dotenvx**, cloning the public repo over HTTPS and running `npm install` (`electron/main.cjs` `dotenvx:check-install` / `dotenvx:install`, `electron/preload.cjs`), with **View on GitHub** as a manual fallback. Previously a fresh Perci install had no path to a working Dotenvx window at all.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-08-22
### Added
- **Apfel Harness auto-start** — opening the Apfel window now auto-launches `node ~/apfel-harness/server.js` via `localhost:start-now` (`src/components/ApfelMode.jsx:82`, `src/lib/localServices.js:29`, `electron/main.cjs:4993`) and polls `localhostCheckHealth` before reloading, mirroring `GithubOverviewMode`. Offline screen shows a **Start Apfel Harness** button on Electron with a starting spinner; browser/non-Mac falls back to manual `cd ~/apfel-harness && npm start`. No terminal workaround needed for Apple Silicon users — the harness supervises `apfel --serve` on `:6272` and reports `on-device` vs `ui only` correctly. Change kept in sync with `~/apfel-harness/perci/ApfelMode.jsx` per `AGENTS.md`.
- **Perci OS Settings — Power, Display, Volume and real-app launcher** — `SystemSettingsMode` (`src/components/SystemSettingsMode.jsx`) with D-Bus/sysfs-backed controls gated by `usePerciOS()` (`src/hooks/usePerciOS.js`), which resolves false outside the Linux OS-shell image (`/etc/perci-os-release`). Power via `logind` + `UPower`, Display via backlight sysfs, Volume via `wpctl`, WiFi via NetworkManager D-Bus (`electron/perci-os.cjs:1`). Launcher now shows installed `.desktop` apps via `SirPerciLauncher.jsx`. Mac app unaffected.
- **Perci OS Settings — WiFi** — NetworkManager D-Bus integration for scan, status, and connect (`electron/perci-os.cjs`).
- **Perci Cloud roadmap** — `ROADMAP.md` parks the paid sync intent (allowlist, E2EE for keys, `perci-data.json` forward-compat) so future persistence/auth work checks it first (`CLAUDE.md`).
- **Automated backup helper** — `scripts/backup-perci.sh` for `perci-data.json`, notes, and related state.

### Fixed
- **Apfel offline UX** — replaced static "Start it from ~/apfel-harness" notice with an actionable launch path; `canStart` is gated by `window.electron.localhostStartNow` so Linux/Windows or missing checkout degrades gracefully rather than showing a broken button.

## [0.18.7] - 2026-06-10
### Changed
- Rebuild with latest artwork and positioning changes.

## [0.18.6] - 2026-06-10

- App.jsx, Dock.jsx, OfficePanel.jsx/CSS updated for new layout integration.

## [0.16.0] - 2026-06-07
### Added
- New **window + dock system** for non-Chat modes — Cowork, Code, Agents, Mission, Build, and OpenClaw open as floating, draggable, resizable windows with macOS traffic-light controls, 8-way resize, double-click maximize, and a bottom dock with whirlpool-minimize and domino chip-in animations.
- Open windows persist across reloads; per-mode geometry is remembered when reopening closed windows.
- Per-window error boundary so a crash in one mode doesn't tear down others.
- **OpenClaw session bridging** (bridge step 3) — Agents panel can run OpenClaw through the gateway agent bridge; Cowork exposes `delegate_to_openclaw` for long-running or multi-step gateway delegation.
- **Gateway health + live event streaming** in Mission Control.
- **Intent-aware search** — `IntelligentSearchTool.planSearch()` classifies each message (intent/reason/searchQueries/freshness/expectedSourceTypes) using the selected model, with deterministic local-fact detection for clock/calendar questions and keyword heuristics as offline fallback. Replaces the old brittle `shouldAutoUseWebSearch` phrase matcher.
- `local_runtime_fact` intent answers date/time/day questions directly from the system clock — no web search needed.
- Relevance scoring (token overlap) sorts search results; weak/empty results trigger honest "I searched but found nothing" model guidance instead of fabricated summaries.
- Odysseus-inspired motion pass for Perci/Mission: whirlpool thinking/search indicators, Mission timeline rails, active synapse pulses, domino list reveal utilities.
- Scoped focus-card hover for Mission Control and guide modals — hovered cards lift/glow while siblings recede.
- Perci product upgrades capture.

### Changed
- Perci web search now uses the desktop `web-search` bridge/native provider search path instead of Tavily.
- Removed dead `analyzeSearchCompleteness` and `isNewsQuery` from `IntelligentSearchTool`.
- OpenClaw dashboard rendered as a window (not fullscreen overlay); redundant inline close button removed (window chrome owns close).

### Fixed
- Prevented EPIPE crash from broken stdout/stderr pipe.
- Cowork jobs no longer cancel when navigating away from the mode.
- Explicit web search toggle now honored correctly.
- Window resize-larger drag fixed via full-viewport drag shield.
- Spurious same-origin full reloads blocked in main-process (prevents SPA state wipe).
- Guide modals no longer reset Advanced tab back to Guide during re-renders.
- Mission guide tab reset on close only (not during background re-renders).
